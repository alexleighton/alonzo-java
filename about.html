<h2>About Alonzo</h2>
<p>
  Alonzo was conceived of while reading a comment
  on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. The comment asked
  for a project that showed how one goes about implementing a functional
  language at a low level and I thought "hey, I can do that", and "that sounds
  like a lot of fun, actually." So, I created this project to scratch a few
  itches and have some fun.
